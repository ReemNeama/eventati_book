This directory contains architectural diagrams and flow documentation for the Eventati Book application.

## Available Documentation

## Purpose

These diagrams serve as visual documentation to help understand:

1. The overall structure of the application
2. How different components interact with each other
3. The user flow through various features
4. The data models and their relationships

## Usage Guidelines

- Use these diagrams as a reference when developing new features
- Update the diagrams when making significant changes to the application structure
- Refer to these diagrams when onboarding new developers

## Diagram Format

The diagrams in this directory use ASCII art for maximum compatibility and version control friendliness. They can be viewed in any text editor or Markdown viewer.

## Future Improvements

In the future, we plan to add:

1. More detailed component diagrams
2. User journey maps
3. State transition diagrams for complex features
4. Interactive diagrams using tools like Mermaid or PlantUML
