## Documentation Types

### Architecture Documentation

Architecture documentation provides a high-level overview of the system design, including component diagrams, data models, and state transition diagrams.

- **Component Diagrams**: Visual representations of the system's components and their interactions
- **Data Models**: Documentation of the data structures used in the application
- **State Diagrams**: Diagrams showing the state transitions for complex features

### Completed Features

Documentation for features that have been fully implemented and are ready for use.

- **Services & Booking Enhancements**: Documentation for calendar integration, email service, and email preference management
- **Vendor Recommendations**: Documentation for the vendor recommendation system

### Development Documentation

Documentation related to the development process, including coding standards, git workflow, and testing strategy.

- **Coding Standards**: Guidelines for code style, organization, and best practices
- **Git Workflow**: Guidelines for branching, committing, and merging code
- **Testing Strategy**: Approach to testing, including unit tests, widget tests, and integration tests

### User Journeys

Documentation of user journeys through the application, including key touchpoints and interactions.
